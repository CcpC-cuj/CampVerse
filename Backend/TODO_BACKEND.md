**Phase 2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All institution module features implemented, tested, and documented.**

---

## 🟠 **Phase 3: Event Module - ✅ COMPLETED**
- [x] Event CRUD operations (Controller/Routes)
- [x] File upload for logo/banner (Google Drive integration, multer middleware)
- [x] RSVP/registration endpoint (creates EventParticipationLog, generates QR code)
- [x] Waitlist logic (users are waitlisted if event is full)
- [x] Email notification with QR code (sent to user on RSVP)
- [x] QR code ticketing and attendance marking (host/co-host scans QR, marks attendance)
- [x] **Event analytics endpoint (registrations, attendance, waitlist, participant details)**
- [x] Co-host nomination and approval workflow (main host nominates, verifier approves/rejects)
- [x] Event verification workflow (verifier approves/rejects event)
- [x] Google Calendar integration (endpoint returns add-to-calendar link)

- [x] Swagger docs for all endpoints
- [x] Role-based access control for all routes

**Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All event module features implemented, tested, and documented. Ready for API testing and frontend integration.**

---

## 🟧 **Host Module (Enhancements) - ✅ COMPLETED**
- [x] Host dashboard: show analytics for each event (registrations, attendance, etc.)
- [x] Host can view/download participant list for their events (name, email, phone, payment type/status, attendance)
- [x] Host-facing QR scanner UI (for event entry validation)
- [x] **Host can see payment type/status for each participant**
- [x] **Host can only generate certificates for users marked as attended (QR scanned)**
- [x] API documentation and tests for analytics endpoints

## 🟡 **Institution Module (Enhancements)**
- [ ] Institution analytics: aggregate event stats, student engagement, event breakdowns
- [ ] Institution dashboard: show analytics and engagement data
- [ ] API documentation and tests for analytics endpoints

## 🟠 **Event Attendance & Co-host Workflow (NEW)**
- [ ] **RSVP attendance tracking:** When a user RSVPs for an event, they receive a QR code (via email and in-app). The QR code must be scanned and verified by the host or an approved co-host at the event to mark attendance. Only after verification will the user be eligible for a certificate.
- [ ] **Co-host workflow:** Host can invite co-hosts for their event. Co-host invitations must be reviewed and approved by a verifier before co-hosts can verify attendance or manage the event.

## 🟣 **Certificate System**
- [ ] **Restrict certificate generation:** Host can generate and share certificates only for users whose attendance has been verified (QR scanned). Backend must ensure only eligible users are sent for certificate generation (ML team handles actual generation).
- [ ] **Export only attended users for ML certificate generation**
- [ ] API documentation and tests for certificate endpoints

## 🟤 **Notification Module (Enhancements)**
- [ ] Email notification logic for event RSVP/registration (with QR ticket)
- [ ] In-app notification for event registration/RSVP
- [ ] Notification preferences (optional)
- [ ] API documentation and tests for notification endpoints

## 🟢 **Google Calendar Integration**
- [ ] Add-to-calendar link generation for events
- [ ] (Optional) Google Calendar API integration for direct event creation (OAuth2 flow)
- [ ] API documentation and tests for calendar endpoints

---

## 🟣 **Phase 4: Certificate System - ✅ COMPLETED**
- [x] Basic certificate generation logic (triggered on event completion, only for 'attended' users)
- [x] Certificate storage and retrieval endpoints
- [x] Certificate verification endpoint (QR code based)
- [x] Certificate templates (basic) - ML API integration
- [x] API documentation and tests for certificate endpoints
- [x] ML API integration for certificate generation
- [x] Export attended users for ML certificate generation
- [x] Certificate retry mechanism for failed generations
- [x] Certificate statistics and analytics
- [x] QR code verification system

**Phase 4 Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All certificate system features implemented with ML API integration, QR verification, and comprehensive API documentation.**

---

## 🟤 **Phase 5: Notification System**
- [ ] Email notification logic (event reminders, role assignments, etc.)
- [ ] In-app notification endpoints
- [ ] Notification preferences (optional)
- [ ] API documentation and tests for notification endpoints

---

## 💳 **Phase 6: Payment System (Last Phase)**
- [ ] Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
- [ ] Host bank account verification system
- [ ] Payment processing for paid events
- [ ] Transaction logging and audit trail
- [ ] Refund handling system
- [ ] Payment dispute resolution
- [ ] Tax calculation and reporting
- [ ] Host payout system
- [ ] Payment security and fraud prevention
- [ ] API documentation and tests for payment endpoints

**Note: Payment system will be implemented after all core event, attendance, and certificate features are complete.**

---

## ⚫ **Phase 7: Analytics & Search**
- [ ] Search analytics collection (track user searches)
- [ ] Event/user search endpoints (advanced filtering)
- [ ] Platform insights/statistics endpoints
- [ ] API documentation and tests for analytics endpoints

---

## ⚪ **General Backend Tasks**
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and input validation across all modules
- [ ] Automated tests for all new endpoints
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all backend APIs
- [ ] Code cleanup and refactoring as needed

---
