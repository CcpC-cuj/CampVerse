Event Recommendation System 
Introduction 
The proliferation of online events and platforms has made personalized 
recommendations crucial for improving user experience. This work focuses 
on a recommendation system that initially relies on content-based filtering 
to recommend events by analyzing users' historical domain preferences 
and continuously update the user profile based on new interactions, 
real-time click and like data 
Problem Statement 
Users often face difficulty in selecting suitable events from a vast pool of 
options. Our goal is to design a system that recommends events aligned 
with a user’s past interests, while enabling future expansion toward 
real-time personalization and collaborative filtering. 
Entities 
User  : Input from users database 
Events : Output from events database 
Approaches 
Batch Model (why not) 
We can’t use batch or offline model directly in this scenario because- 
➔ At starting we don’t have events ( or too many events to train and 
recommend) 
➔ the event (output) dataset is not static, new events keeps adding in 
the dataset 
➔ the human behaviour is dynamic (need to monitor regularly) 
Using Scheduler  (Plan A) 
● Use batch  model  
● Fetch data & train model regularly manually using scheduler 
Online Model  (Plan B) 
● So we have to use online (Incremental) model 
● It’s a dynamic model which will train regularly in a fixed duration 
● Model will change as new data arrives 
● More uses more accurate results 
● Algorithms used -  incremental Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), 
Passive-Aggressive algorithms,  Perceptron and Adaline. 
Jugaad  ( Plan C ) 
● Combination of plan A and B 
● Use partial_fit() to train on only new data regularly 
● Then use scheduler for regular training 
Data Needed 
●   The most liked domain of the user ( taken as an input at the time of 
user registration ) 
●   Last 10 previous search or explored history  (from user database 
that will stores this information) 
●   Attended events  (from user database) 
●   Wishlist or liked events  (optional) 
Methodology 
❖ Data Representation 
1. User Profile Creation 
● Extract features from past events liked or attended by the 
use 
● Domains such as: Technology, Music, Sports, Art, 
Finance, etc. 
● Build a user preference vector from domain frequencies 
or TF-IDF-style weights. 
2. Event Feature Extraction 
● Represent each event with its content features ( metadata 
like - category, tags, keywords). 
● Apply vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, 
embeddings). 
❖ Recommendation Process 
1. Similarity Calculation 
● Use Cosine Similarity between the user profile vector and event 
feature vectors. 
● Rank events based on similarity scores. 
2. Recommendation Generation 
● Recommend top-N events most similar to the user's interest 
vector 
Technologies Used 
● Python 
● Pandas, NumPy 
● Scikit-learn 
● Matplotlib/Seaborn 
● NLP 
● Cosine Similarity 
● Collaborative filtering 
Future Work 
● Add User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Leverage behavior of 
similar users for improved recommendation diversity. 
● Hybrid Model: Combine content-based and user-based collaborative 
methods for robustness.
